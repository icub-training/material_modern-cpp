# The environment

We need an environment where to run our exercises. As they come with `Cmake` there are several possibilities. We propose two:

- a  `gitpod` environment ready to use with `Visual Studio Code`,
- a `Ubuntu` 2022.04 environment in `WSL2` with `Visual Studio Code`.



In the following are basic instructions for preparing these two environments.



## Setting up `gitpod`



This environment is ready to use and requires only a browser. Instructions of its use are in here.

In here are instructions about how to use `gitpod`



1. log in

   ![gitpod-20240502124437655](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502124437655.png)

2. then open a workspace w/ CTRL + O. Open your forked repository: `https://github.com/marcoaccame/material_modern-cpp`

   ![gitpod-20240502124750209](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502124750209.png)

4. after some preparation your environment will appear

   ![gitpod-20240502124929404](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502124929404.png)

5. use it for:

   - visualizing .md files

   - for compiling and running code

     ![gitpod-20240502125615560](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502125615560.png)
   
     ![gitpod-20240502125640364](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502125640364.png)
   
   - for debugging

     ![gitpod-20240502130000147](./environment.assets/gitpod-20240502130000147.png)
